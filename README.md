# Tic Tac Toe Using State Machines

A simple implementation of tic tac toe using state machines. All the game logic is processed on the server and the front end updates based on the
updated game context as the game changes states in response to user moves.

##

To start the game:

```typescript
// starts up the front end on port 5173
npm run dev

// starts up the server on port 3000 that exposes api endpoints to manipulate the state machine
npm run machine
```
